    <h1 class="centered" style="color: blue;">Welcome to SCS</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Dean Brosnan and I am an 11 year old entrepreneur.
        I am also the proud owner of SCS (Supreme Cubing Shop), which I have spent a lot of time on.
        SCS is a service dedicated to selling speedcubes to the locals of Ireland.
        I sell all different kinds of cubes from budget to high end flagship cubes.
        The purpose of SCS is to make it easier and cheaper to supply cubes to the people of the Republic of Ireland.
        I sell cubes from 3x3 to 7x7 and other puzzles (such as the pyraminx, skewb, square-1, e.t.c.) on my website.
        The way I make it decently affordable is by making to smallest profit you could imagine.
        I only make â‚¬2.40 per sale which is not a lot for what I sell. For me to have a small stock of each item I would need a lot of sales, which is not common at the time of me writing this.
        I would appreciate if you could show support for my small company.
        Thank you for reading this small paragraph of info.
    </p>
